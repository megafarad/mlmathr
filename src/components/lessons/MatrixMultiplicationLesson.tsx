                        Multiplying two matrices is more than just matching numbers — it's about combining transformations,
                        data, or weights depending on what you're building. But before you can do that, you need to understand
                        how matrix multiplication works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, not all matrices can be multiplied together. You can only multiply a matrix <code>A</code> by a
                        matrix <code>B</code> if the number of <strong>columns in A</strong> is the same as the number of
                        <strong> rows in B</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, if A is a <code>2×3</code> matrix (2 rows, 3 columns) and B is a <code>3×2</code> matrix (3 rows, 2 columns),
                        then you can multiply them. The result will be a <strong>2×2</strong> matrix — because A has 2 rows and B has 2 columns.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each number in the result comes from taking a <strong>row from A</strong> and a <strong>column from B</strong>,
                        multiplying the numbers in those positions together, and adding them up. That process is called the <em>dot product</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, if the first row of A is <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> and the first column of B is <code>[4, 5, 6]</code>,
                        then their dot product is:
                    </p>

                    <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded"><code>
    1×4 + 2×5 + 3×6 = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32
  </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        That value (32) becomes the entry in the first row, first column of the result.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the visual below, try clicking a result cell to see the row and column that produced it — and how the
                        dot product math works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        🎯 Try clicking a cell where the dot product equals <strong>32</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className='flex flex-col items-center space-y-4'>
                    <MatrixMultiplicationVisualizer onGoalAchieved={() => setGoalAchieved(true)} />
                    {!goalAchieved && (
                        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                            🎯 Adjust the matrix values so that <strong>one of the result cells equals 28</strong>, then click that cell.
                        </p>
                    )}
                    {goalAchieved && <CompleteLessonButton lessonId={lessonId} />}
                    <NextUpButton currentLessonId={lessonId}/>
                </div>
